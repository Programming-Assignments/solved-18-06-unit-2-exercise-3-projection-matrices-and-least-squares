<strong>Problem</strong> <strong>16.1:</strong> (4.3 #17. <em>Introduction</em> <em>to</em> <em>Linear</em> <em>Algebra:</em> Strang) Write down three equations for the line <em>b</em> = <em>C</em> + <em>Dt</em> to go through <em>b</em> = 7 at <em>t</em> = −1, <em>b</em> = 7 at <em>t</em> = 1, and <em>b</em> = 21 at <em>t</em> = 2. Find the least squares solution <strong>xˆ </strong>= (<em>C</em>, <em>D</em>) and draw the closest line.

<strong>Problem</strong> <strong>16.2:</strong> (4.3 #18.) Find the projection <strong>p</strong> = <em>A</em><strong>xˆ </strong>in the previous problem. This gives the three heights of the closest line. Show that the error vector is <strong>e</strong> = (2, −6, 4). Why is <em>P</em><strong>e</strong> = <strong>0</strong>?

<strong>Problem</strong> <strong>16.3:</strong> (4.3 #19.) Suppose the measurements at <em>t</em> = −1,1,2 are the errors 2, -6, 4 in the previous problem. Compute <strong>xˆ </strong>and the closest line to these new measurements. Explain the answer: <strong>b</strong> = (2, −6, 4) is perpendicular to so the projection is <strong>p</strong> = <strong>0</strong>.

<strong>Problem</strong> <strong>16.4:</strong> (4.3 #20.) Suppose the measurements at <em>t</em> = −1,1,2 are <strong>b</strong> = (5, 13, 17). Compute <strong>xˆ </strong>and the closest line and <strong>e</strong>. The error is <strong>e</strong> = <strong>0</strong> because this <strong>b</strong> is .

<strong>Problem</strong> <strong>16.5:</strong> (4.3 #21.) Which of the four subspaces contains the error vector <strong>e</strong>? Which contains <strong>p</strong>? Which contains <strong>xˆ</strong>? What is the nullspace of <em>A</em>?

<strong>Problem</strong> <strong>16.6:</strong> (4.3 #22.) Find the best line <em>C</em> + <em>Dt</em> to fit <em>b</em> = 4, 2, −1,0,0 at times <em>t</em> = −2, −1, 0, 1, 2.
